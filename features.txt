Add little blinking animation when snake hits
https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/5c0268411b9a293534ecbcb5e04e8e860d2c2d2f/docs/Effects.md#dispatch-later

The next-state handler checks if there is a collision. now it sets :game-running to false.
If there is no collision it moves the snake andprocesses the move.

What we want: if there is a collision:
- stop movement
- blink the snake head a few times
- :game-running=false

with reg-event-fx we can also register effects. there are standard effects,
like :dispatch and :dispatch-later

so if the next state handler:
 - returns a :dispatch-later to :blink-snake-head which takes a countdown value

the handler for :blink-snake-head
- updates the snake model, to reflect the state of the snake head (this can be a toggle
- creates a :dispatch-later with a reduced counter to itself if the counter > 0
